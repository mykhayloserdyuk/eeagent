# EEAgent

An OpenAI based JetBrains Plugin that fixes all errors in a file by precompiling the fixed code. This way you can be sure not to run into even more errors while trying to fix your code with LLMs.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project was made as a part of the JetBrains Challange at hackaTUM 2024. This plugin was created in less than 36 hours and therefore does not aim to be a perfect plugin.
